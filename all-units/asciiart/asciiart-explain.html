    <h1>ASCII Art Depicted</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>It is actually really easy to make ASCII Art, once you know that every image is simply a matrix of its pixel values!</p>
    <p>We read each pixel value, and based on if it is a dark, medium, or a light color we simply put a specific character in its spot! </p>
    <br>
    <p>Few things to note:</p>
    <p>For color images, each pixel value is actually four values - red, green, blue and alpha numbers - so we take the average of the numbers as the pixel value</p>
    <p>Having a text character for every pixel value may not produce the right image, as a character is actually a rectange while a pixel is a tiny square. We want to group pixels into a single character!</p>
    <p>We can do this by setting the height and width of each character to represent multiple pixel values! We form sub-matrices of dimensions height X width and the average pixel value of this sub-matrix will form one character!</p>
