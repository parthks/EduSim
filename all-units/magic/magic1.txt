pick a num
double it
add 8
divide 2
subtract original number

==> result is 4 :P
linear algebra since its algebra with linear terms
(2x + 8) / 2 = x+4
x+4 - x ==> 4 LOL




pick a num bw 10-83
find the sum of the 2 digits, eg 21=> 2+1=3
subtract this sum from the original number, eg 21-3=18
Then ask the user to concentrate of a table with numbers and speical char next to the numbers


10a + b - (a+b) = 9a, so always multiple of 9 ==> thus all multiples of 9 same char, except 81 since not poss to get






Magic Answer = 5+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 14

 5 2 1
38 5 4
27 4 3
16 3 2

Magic Table:
8 5 4
7 4 3
6 3 2

pick a number remove the row and column it is in, eg 8 so remove 8 5 4 and 8 7 6
so now table is:
4 3
3 2
pick another number the same way, eg 2 so now table is:
4
and another the same way, well just 4 remains!
adding all the numbers u picked ==> 8+2+4 = 14 <- the magic answer :P


Notice how there's underlying structure in the matrix.
But unless you're told what that structure is
and how that structure led to the matrix, it can be hard to see.
Linear algebra will enable us to uncover structure and information
within matrices.
The structure of the matrices are magical, sometimes quite literally!
